all different object types need to be given well defined types

within the posts service, for example,
there is the type of data that is submitted by the user
then there is this.data type which should be fine before and after cleaning
then there is the type of object stored within the database
then there is the type of that document that has been mutated so that it can be suitably served to the client

types:
- postSubmission Type
- post's this.data Type
- postDocumentType
- postForClient Type
