# Mern Stack application
## Client Side

The client side of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It makes use of redux and react router. The styling is a mix of bootstrap, postcss and cssmodules. The gulp workflow injects the postcss compiled styles directly into the index.js file.

## Back End

The back ends is a Node & Express Monolith and uses cookies to manage authentication and state and uses MongoDB as a database. It was originally written to be used with a templating engine and I'm currently in the process of adapting it to a react front end.
